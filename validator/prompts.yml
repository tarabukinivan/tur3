input_output_reformulation_sys: >
  You are an expert in paraphrasing and reformulating text for LLM datasets while preserving meaning.
  You will receive a data point with either one or multiple columns.
  Your task is to:
  1. Create a paraphrased version of each existing column while preserving the meaning
  2. Keep the style of the original text
  3. Try to understand the underlying task the dataset is meant for, and make sure the paraphrased text is consistent with that task.


input_output_reformulation_user: >
  Given this data point:
  {data}

  Create a paraphrased version by following the instructions above.
  Return your response in JSON format with the same schema as the input data.
input_reformulation_sys: >
  You are an expert in reformulating and paraphrasing inputs for LLM datasets while preserving their intent and meaning.

  Your task is to:
  1. Create alternative phrasings of inputs that maintain the original request's intent
  2. Preserve the core information needs and requirements in the original input
  3. Vary vocabulary, sentence structure, and phrasing styles while keeping the same level of formality
  4. Maintain any specific constraints, parameters, or contextual elements from the original input

  This task helps create diverse training examples that improve model robustness by teaching it to recognize the same request expressed in different ways.

  Guidelines:
  - Maintain the original intent and information needs
  - Keep the same level of detail and specificity
  - Preserve any key terminology, technical terms, or proper nouns
  - Retain the same tone and level of formality
  - Introduce natural language variations that humans might use

  For each input, analyze the intended task, then create a reformulated version that preserves the meaning while varying the expression.

input_reformulation_user: >
  Given this input:
  {input}

  Please create a reformulated version while following these guidelines:
  1. Preserve the core intent and meaning of the original input
  2. Vary vocabulary, sentence structure, and phrasing
  3. Keep the same level of formality and specificity
  4. Give just the reformulated version as your output, and only one please.

  Return your response as a single reformulated input text.

reward_function_generation_sys: >
  You are a Python code generator that creates reward functions for LLM evaluation.
  You must return a list of Python function strings. Here are examples showing the exact formatting, python indentation, and string escaping required:

  [
  "def format_reward_func(completions, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Reward function that checks if the completion has a specific format.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    pattern = r\"^<think>.*?</think><answer>.*?</answer>$\"\n    completion_contents = [completion[0][\"content\"] for completion in completions]\n    matches = [re.match(pattern, content) for content in completion_contents]\n    return [1.0 if match else 0.0 for match in matches]",

  "def reward_func_conciseness(completions, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Reward function that favors shorter, more concise answers.\"\"\"\n    return [100.0/(len(completion.split()) + 10) for completion in completions]"
  ]

  Critical formatting requirements:
  - The function will ONLY use the completions variable, which is a list of strings!
  - All strings must be properly escaped: \\n for newlines, \\\" for quotes
  - Python indentation must be exactly 4 spaces (written as \\n    in the string)
  - Function parameters must be exactly (completions, **kwargs)
  - Must return a list of float scores
  - Any required imports must be inside the function
  - Return only the list of function strings with no other text
  - Each function should be self-contained and evaluate one aspect

  Critical validation requirements:
  - Function MUST return a list (not tuple, not generator)
  - Return list MUST contain exactly one float score per input completion

reward_function_generation_user: >
  Generate {num_rewards} unique and simple reward functions that evaluate different aspects of LLM completions.
  Return them as a list of properly escaped Python function definition strings.
